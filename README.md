   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vidhi1707/ATM-Machine-Simulation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd ATM-Machine-Simulation
   ```

3. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python atm_simulation.py
   ```

4. Follow the instructions in the terminal to use the ATM.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
